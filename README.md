# NeoDrift: Interactive Neon Dragon

!

**NeoDrift** is a dynamic, interactive web project featuring a responsive neon dragon that follows the user's mouse pointer. Built purely with **HTML, CSS (SVG styling), and Vanilla JavaScript**, it showcases fluid animation and real-time aesthetic state changes using glow filters.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Fluid Motion:** The dragon's body segments follow a physics-based chain reaction, resulting in smooth, lifelike movement.
* **Interactive Control:** The dragon head (the first segment) is directly controlled by the mouse pointer/touch input.
* **Aesthetic State Change:** The dragon's glow color dynamically changes based on its movement state:
    * **Neon Blue:** When the dragon is stretched out (moving quickly).
    * **Deep Red/Orange:** When the dragon is coiled up (moving slowly or idle).
    * **Gold:** For the dragon's head.
    * **Vibrant Green:** For the dragon's fins/wings.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.
